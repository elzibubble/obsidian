# Scenes
Teaser: The show opens on the front of Cagney's Curiosities, a small antique and memorabilia store on the corner of Arlington Ave. and Clover St. in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The shop is obviously closed, the sign turned but lights still on inside. We see a shapely young woman inside, busying about, ending the day. The lights go out. We hear a moment later, a scream. A young man passing, walking his bicycle, drops it and runs to the front door. Trying to open it and finding it locked, he yells in "Yo, everybody OK in there?". He stumbles back as from the darkened storefront, he sees the woman collapse against the glass door, blood streaming from her face and slowly sliding out of sight. The man curses and stumbles backwards, taking out his phone. The camera pans up over the lights of Pittsburgh as sirens begin to wail.
