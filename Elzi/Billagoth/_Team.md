Dad (cop) killed his mom. Took him to the mine.

I knew Shayne first. I tapped George for his camera (how long ago?). About a year ago, Travis dumped Ronnie and Jamie moved to town.

Shayne: He does his best to protect her from bullying at school, so she tutors him to save him from summer school and helps him with the wiring on his bike.
Jamie: Introduced her to modern music that excites her. Shares an interest in Billagoth weirdness, Jamie is more holistic whereas Alisha is task-oriented (Carter).
Ronnie: Best friend. Admires Ronnie's charisma, attitude and ability to get results. Also, the only other outcast girl.
George: Her parents think he's a bad influence and a bad connection to have.
