Premise: It’s late August, 1983, a couple weeks into your last year of middle school. You’re all classmates, and you’re all outcasts, which is why you’ve been friends for at least a year. Some of you may even be lifelong friends. This summer, you gave yourselves intense makeovers into ‘badasses’: punks, rockers, goths, greasers, you name it. The hope was that this would intimidate your bullies and lead them to choose someone else to pick on. However, your bullies seem to be giving you even more attention than before!
