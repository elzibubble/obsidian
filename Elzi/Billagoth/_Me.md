1️⃣ Electronics nerd, old car nerd, black, curvy, thick cat-eye glasses with black rims
2️⃣ C-suite goth, "taking executive literally" - black suit with waistcoat, crisp white shirt, heavy underliner + black lipstick
3️⃣ When I was 3, my 7yo bro Carter went missing in the statuary park while my mom was cleaning one of the neighbouring apartments. I was never left unsupervised again, hung out with Abe a lot and learned about cars.
Glossophobia - public speaking
True fear - being forgotten, dying unknown, plays into Carter + mom
Good listener, vault of secrets

Lockpicking hobby
Favourite song: Slowdive by Siouxsie Sioux

Dad: Abe Wright, born '41, car mechanic and handyman. Moved here '62 from Clarksville, expected to buy into Lakeside Auto Specialists (it's right on the edge of The Works) for cheap with his uncle (Isaiah Wright). Numbed after it was instead sold '65 to Shane Reeve's aunt (Letitia J. Jones aka Big Momma). Still works there though. Attends the Church of St Solomon devoutly, praying for prosperity. Has nightmares about hellfire. Reverend loaned him a bit of money after losing the shop, since paid back but Abe ignores warning signs around the Reverend.

Mom: Ella Wright née Simmons, born '44, works at the diner and cleans the fire station each morning. Wrote a sci-fi, murder mystery musical that she wanted to perform on Broadway but followed Abe from Clarksville to save some money first. Had three kids - Carter ('66), Alisha ('70) and Solomon ('77) who was stillborn. Investigated Carter's death ('73) from '75-'77 but was blocked out by the cops.

Carter: Used to be friends with Charlie, who was 3 years older than him.

Picked on by Conor, a skinhead, vandal and petty criminal, son of police chief.

Catalyst: A year ago, I saw a 6-7yo Carter in the statuary park asylum garden, then sought George to borrow his camera and visited again but didn't see him.
