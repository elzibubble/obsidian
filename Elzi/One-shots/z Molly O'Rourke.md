Molly O'Rourke. 18. 5'6" (1.68m), 75kg
Garden of the Hesperides / Street Fighter
Influences: Vi, Poison Ivy, Lift

Pale white skin, bright pink undercut mullet
She's wearing a leather jacket with popped collar, lime green string vest over ex-white sports bra, forest green combat trousers and too-big black boots. Her nose bears a small septum ring and her left eyebrow is pierced. There's a 3" scar running northeast past the left side of her mouth.

Dad left and Mom died in childbirth. That just left me and Pop-pop. We did OK for a while, he had a good factory job, until he got laid off when I was 14. Since then... I've been fighting every day. To stay above water, to keep the boots off our heads. Six months ago, some fuck shanked Pop-pop. Left him to bleed out in a goddamn gutter. Probably some gangbanger bitch I gave a slap, out for revenge. But nothing's adding up, all the clues are dead ends.
