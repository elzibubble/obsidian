### E00

We found some pills on some Russians that were shaking down a store for protection. They didn't seem to be feeling pain, Giuseppe beaned one right in the beans. One cut my arm. G did some bad shit to them to stop them getting back into action anytime soon. My dad kept calling for some damn reason.
