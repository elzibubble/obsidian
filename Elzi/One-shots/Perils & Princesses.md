Fairy Godmother: Pure silvery MIST. They speak in riddles on the wind.

Around 5'10" and slim, with light blue skin and small, handle-like black horns rising from her head. Black hair shines like glass, cut long in front with a straight line up to the nape of the neck. Her eyes are soft and slightly tilted, with purple eyeshadow and dark natural liner, while her wide mouth bears generous, gently violet lips. A bright blue silk ribbon is tied around her slender neck. She is wearing a corseted leotard, covered with tight, bright red leather belts, except without the leotard so her smooth curves bulge through lasciviously. Her arms are likewise bound in red gloves up past her elbows, frequently belted and each belt sealed with a padlock, only allowing her dark claws to poke through the ends of each finger. Her digitigrade legs are long, bare and flawless, ending in petite hooves.

Father is Desire, mother is Lust

**(sung to the chorus of Popular by Ariana Grande)**
Beautiful
I am just so beautiful
Oh I bet you like this face, such unearthly grace
Stirring how I roll~ and bounce,
I'm strapped up tight in leather, don't mind the weather
There's a spark inside me but I'm so

Beautiful
I'm implacably beautiful
Check out my honeydew chest, and all the rest,
Do I recall~ a fruit bowl?
Made of sinful curves like these, Hell knows how to please
You won't sniff a whiff of someone as

Beautiful
Can't stop being beautiful
Listen I know it's a gift, but it's caused a rift
Is this my tota~lity?
I need a li'l room to grow, All I want to know
Simply how do I escape, being

Beautiful.
