I generally started with Eye makeup when I started because it's easier to mess up and then you can remove/fix it without smudging your other makeup

Eye makeup:

Step 1: moisturise face and let sit for 10 minutes.

Step 2: if concealing under eyes do that now! (Step 4 in the next section)

Step 3: eyeshadow primer
Put a small blob on your hand and apply to the area between your eyes and your eyebrows and just brush out until it's set and you don't notice it being there.
You can get away with no eyeshadow primer, it's good for practicing as removing eyeshadow that's not on primer is much easier and its more forgiving with how it sticks but you may have to apply multiple times to get it to stick and your eyeshadow will smudge after a few hours (even after just blinking) so it is not advisable to go out without eyeshadow primer on

Step 4: eyeshadow
I like to place eyeshadow only on my eyelids, I tend to do a black to grey gradient or just pink with maybe some sparkly white in the inner corner and then I take a clean brush and slightly blend it upwards outside of my eyelid to make it smoother (be extremely careful with bold colours!!)
Everyone's eyes are very different though, some people just prefer to put lots of eyeliner on (after full face) and call it a day, it's best if you explore what works for you through practice. 


Full face:

Step 1: moisturise (if not done already)

Step 2: primer (in video on foundation), use a small blob

Step 3: foundation (you can also apply small smears around your face and brush/blend it out, careful with amount used)

(Blend with beauty blender after application)

Step 4: concealer 
Can be used on upper lip or under eyes combined with contour/nude eyeshadow to warm up and area where there may be shadows.
Can also be used with contour to shape nose

Step 5: setting powder (optional but recommended)

Step 6: contour 
Contour can be applied in a number of different ways, for a transfem face I personally use it under my jawline (and blended down) to define my face and warm up any small stubble/dark colour from facial hair as well as in the upper triangles of my hairline to round it off (be very careful if doing this with tied back hair as you want the effect to be subtle)

Contour can then be applied to a number of places, I usually do a curved line along my cheeks

Step 7: blush 
Blush can be applied in many places like contour. I'd normally just recommend doing a line from beside your eyes to your mid cheek that starts thin and gets thicker, it's very easy to do. For best results change your beauty blender before blending out blush so it stays on top 

Step 8: brow permade/brow pencil

Fairly easy, just to fill in brows if you want. Brow gel is not needed

Step 9: highlight
Highlighter is mostly optional but can be used on your nose (with contour on the sides


Back to eyes:

Eyeliner: eyeliner is a pain in the arse 
It takes lots of practice, start with a small amount in the corner/wing and then go over your eyelid. Because my vision is bad I keep both eyes open and squint a little but it does work best if you can close one. A close mirror and good lighting goes a long way but it's still difficult.
Some cheats and tips I've found are:
Line your eyelids with a thin line of black eyeshadow (before applying the rest of the eyeshadow!) if using a darker eyeshadow colour (make sure to blend it in!!) that way it you miss the eyeliner at all or make small mistakes it's difficult to notice!
You can also start with a pencil before moving onto an ink liner, they're easier to control and if you let the product dry it can be scratched off with a nail inside kitchen roll.

Mascara:
Mascara is very easy, just needs to be done slowly. I'd just get an all in one mascara product and brush and then just brush your top eyelashes up and your bottom ones down. You can also hold it in place in front of your eye and blink.
Crimping eyelashes is not necessary but you can do it

Dry mascara can be scratched off with kitchen roll over a nail if you get it on your skin!

Lipstick:
I generally just use a tinted lip gloss but if you want to apply lipstick remember that less is more (close your lips after application to fully cover) and consider using lip paint with a brush for easier and more precise control.
Remember that it your makeup is light/bright use subtler colours closer to your lip colour/nuder colours and if your makeup is warmer you can use darker colours/bolder colours as the contrast won't be as harsh
Overlining your lips with a lip liner can be a great way to get volume and to help them stand out, I've personally done it a lot.

Setting spray:
Close your eyes and spray setting spray over your whole face (assuming you've used powder products, you should set powder products with liquid and liquid products with powder and that's why setting powder is useful after foundation and concealer).
Setting spray can be reapplied at any point if makeup feels dry or itchy or melty, just make sure to let it dry before touching any part of your face.


Some general tips:

-wear a headband to prevent hair on face, it goes a mile
-BLEND BLEND BLEND BLEND BLEND BLEND BLEND it fixes so many things
-this tutorial is based off of liquid foundation and concealer as they fill gaps more and are better and then powder contour, blush and highlight because they're easier to work with and fix if you make a mistake
-use primers and setting stuff if wearing for makeup for a long time, trust me
-eye makeup (+ lips if you want) by itself is a good quick look :)
-nude eyeshadow/contour can be used to correct small mistakes in places 
-reapply setting spray, lipstick (and possibly eyeliner if wearing for 10+ hours) when needed
-try not to touch/itch face, applying setting spray when out to add moisture helps
-practice really does make perfect but it also really doesn't take long to get good enough to do it by yourself with few problems. I have terrible dexterity (awful handwriting) and absolutely awful vision without glasses on (+5, +3) and it took me probably 5 applications to get happy with everything except eyeliner.
-if you do makeup in bright light to see step away and examine in natural/room light before judging it, it often appears harsher in bright white light and you can be your own worst critic
-[more advanced/specific tips] use reds/pinks to help disguise darker areas (shadows) and greens to disguise red areas (acne etc) under foundation 
-all these steps are modular, if you're not a fan of eye shadow or blush or foundation, you don't need to do it! As long as you're aware of not putting dry product on top of wet product youll be absolutely fine
