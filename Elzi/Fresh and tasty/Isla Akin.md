Sent her daughter away when things looked bad in her country, now she has fled herself and is looking for her.

Hey, over there! What's your name? 
Hi, Ox! Where you from? 
Oh i visited there once, isn't it lovely? Are your folks still there? 
Oh I'm sorry, do you want to talk about it?
OR oh that's so good to hear
Now look my fine friend, can I call you my friend Ox? Wonderful,  thank you
Now that we're such good friends, you think you could let us by?


Vicious Mockery

Your mother would be ashamed of you!
You are not very kind!
Make good choices!
What would your mother think of this behaviour?
I am very disappointed in you.
Is this how you were raised?
Violence only begets more violence!
You're being such a sillyhead right now


Phantasmal Force

Go to sleep, now goodnight
Where you stand, out like a light,
Gentle creatures of the way
Must have rest from work and play.
When the new day shall break
Full of joy you will wake
When the new day shall break
Full of joy you will wake. 


Suggestion

That armour looks real heavy, you should take it off.
They're hiring police officers in Little Meldon, you should apply!
Tell the truth and we can work this out I'm sure.
No thank you, timeout for you buster! Sit down and be quiet!
