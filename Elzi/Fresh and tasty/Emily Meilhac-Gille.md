I'd like to theme a glaive as "my leg/foot". It's a pretty heavy reskin, is this OK?

Emily is eight feet tall if she's an inch and well over half of that is leg. Tawny skin with cool undertones, dark eyes and sky-high cheekbones are complemented by bright red lipstick and wavy, blackest black hair. She often wears a short black-and-gold leather bustier atop striped black-and-grey hose, to maximise and minimise her respective assets. Today her proportions are disguised by a suit of padding, chainmail and full-plate gauntlets and sabatons.

Grew up in Jigow. Amused a storm giant by winning a no-holds-barred under-18s unarmed fighting contest at only 16. The giant blessed me with strength, I started to grow again and I was sent to the city as a ward. Eloise Balmonte knew my grandfather (adventured or went to school?) and my mother as a child.

Little boobs for her height and a bit sensitive about it.
Frequently (mis?)quotes Eloise, but cannot possibly conceive of any romantic interest in her.
Dislikes money and makes Eloise handle it.
Completely dependent on Eloise for life direction: "I'll be dead before Eloise begins to grey"
Gets lost easily, dislikes being alone.
Wraps her hair to sleep.
Addicted to sweet things but only stares
Artist?
Easy martial confidence, socially innocent, morally ignorant.
Later, add little scabbards on the inside of each ankle, containing spring-suspended blades.
