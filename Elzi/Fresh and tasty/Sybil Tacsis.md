As a young noblewoman, Sybil was given to vice, first just a few drinks and a handsome boy, then circling into basest debauchery. She attracted the attention of Vesh, the Bloody Siren, who granted her divine power in return for her devotion. The depravity continued until Sybil realised she would not survive it much longer and turned away from Vesh. Her body bears many marks to this day, which she covers with high collars and long sleeves. Though she no longer prays to Vesh, she retains a measure of power, just a taste, and enough good memories to perhaps lure her back one day.

Steeling herself, she began an academic study of blood magic and has developed some facility in the arcane. Studies require funds however and needs must. She has no problem joining some do-gooders if they will facilitate her progress.

#### Allies
Sybil has been toying with a rather well-connected nobleman of late, by the name of Asterius Lake. Life can't be all books, after all.
#### Enemies
The Bloody Church of Vesh do not appreciate disloyalty and do not trust to discretion.
