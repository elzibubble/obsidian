Daughter of a noble family, turns out Dad loves alchemy more than her. Gave her a potion that goblinized her into a bugbearish thing. Smuggled out by a loyal retainer, grew up among lumberjacks. Resents the aristocracy and wants to overthrow them.

Originally planned out as bugbear gloomstalker/assassin/warlock monstrosity, off flagship.
