Lumberjack looking outsider, lately punk. 27-28, no attachments.
Getting suspicious of l'Seira.

Stella bailed her out of a supermarket holding cell after getting in a fight, while on "Ted", with Ted himself. She says Ted was the only instigator... the opposite is most likely true.

Trusts Rukia to let her off the leash, this happened on "Ted, Again".

Movie choice is 80s action + horror.
