Nyssa - Brick / Aelid Callister / Saga of Folly
Paige - Comet / Hailey Beck / Fido

Vesper Corano (she) is famously a hardass, career soldier. Great leader, was in charge of us at the academy.

STAG, Corey Statler, accompanies. Mousy kid, bright + optimistic. Everest splashed with paint. Support.

Brick took Comet on her first training mission, CtF mission. Comet took it hard. I joined the academy a year later but managed to skip a year. After the CtF, I got Comet to buck up and gave some first aid - she helps me with my mech repairs. Brick is working through an addiction to combat stims, which she still uses. Mercy discovered her spinning out one time.

STAG got instantly smoked.

#### Aftermath

Casey Conrad, callsign DEFCON - believes someone on the UNS Odysseus wants us dead

---

Taking a blinkgate to our next assignment. Received letters from those we helped, to reduce burnout. Mercy read a piece of one, about helping a family, then stuffed the rest at the bottom of her duffel without reading them. 

New Vangelis on Justicia! Had a lot of trouble adapting to the three pillars (material needs; no walls between worlds; no slavery/indenture). Mayor has been fabricating econ reports. All female Fighters4Freedom anarchists bombed a morgue. NVPeacekeepers put them down hard. Our job to stop escalation.

Capt Discalda of NVPF vs Riddick Alistei F4F. Admin Kalassi has been working on this. Discalda looks way down on the streets, I remind them they are supposed to be "Servants of the People". I negotiate from Admin an investigative unit to the morgue in the next 72h. We take a break, come back, Discalda offers F4F to leave without investigation, F4F kick off, we hit the elevators.
