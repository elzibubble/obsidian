54 blocks means 17 layers
Remove middle spends the whole layer, for low risk
Remove side removes half a layer, for high risk
Adjust, to reduce risk?
Every 3 moves adds a layer

Moves:
* Safe: -2 layer, roll 3d20kh2 vs instability, +1 instability
* Risk: -1 layer, roll 2d20 vs instability, +2 instability
* Adjust: Roll, stabilise, go again
Afterwards, add a brick, if there are 3 bricks then add a layer.
Game over when there's only 1 layer left.
