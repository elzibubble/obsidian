	Did I say stand there and look stupid? Do it
	I'd love to help you out. Exits over there
	Someday you’ll go far. And I really hope you stay there
	Remember the time you were saying that thing I didn’t care about? Yeah, that is now.
	It’s impossible to underestimate you.
	I’ll never forget the first time we met. But I’ll keep trying.
	I’m not insulting you, I’m describing you.
	You have an entire life to be an idiot. Why not take today off?
	I’m an acquired taste. If you don’t like me, acquire some taste.
	Keep trying, with some real effort you could reach mediocre.
	I’d agree with you but then we’d both be wrong
	Sorry, not sorry.
	If I throw a stick, will you leave?
	It's cute how you're still trying to keep up.
	Don’t feel bad. A lot of people have no talent.
	Did your parents ever ask you to run away from home?
	Don’t get bitter, just get better.
	There you go, believing everything you think again.
