AKA Sister Wheel. Ample of bosom, holy priest of Hestia the hearth-maiden. Light, food, comfort, succor. Uses a shepherd's crook. Nah not really, she just dressed up to seduce a nun.

In reality, she is a highly educated mercenary of no fixed abode, living by her wits. Born to a high noble family (Giovanni) but long since disgraced and disowned.

Scoundrel: explore new horizons vs commitment
Inner conflict: believes in nothing, consumed by ennui

##### Living in the Moment
Needs to find someone or something to truly care about.
##### Heat of the Moment
When you taunt someone into doing something they want to do but find unwise, roll **+Daring**:
*If the target is an NPC:*
10+: They’ll do it in exchange for a small concession or reassurance
7–9: They choose 1
* Create an opportunity for you or your allies
* They give you a String on them

*If the target is a PC:*
10+: They mark XP if they do it, and must take a Condition if they don’t
7–9: You choose 1
* They mark XP if they do it
* They take a Condition if they don’t

For either a PC or an NPC, if you aren’t already Smitten with them, you may choose to treat a 7–9 result as a 10+ by choosing to become Smitten with the target.
##### Lust at First Sight
When you become Smitten with someone you barely know, declare your undying love and give them a String on you. Lose your Smitten status with anyone who has no Strings on you. Take +1 forward to any act you think might impress your new interest.
##### Shiny and New
When you give or receive Emotional Support in an intimate moment with someone new, you each mark XP or clear a Condition.
##### Fools Rush In
When you vault into a situation without forethought and wind up way over your head, give someone dangerous to you a String, mark XP, and take +1 forward to Defy Disaster.
##### Rrrip!
When you take or narrowly evade a physical blow from someone dangerous to you, you may declare that your clothes were damaged and are now practically indecent. For the remainder of the scene, when you roll a 10+ on any move against an NPC, you may declare that they have a crush on you (up to one NPC per roll and subject to GM discretion). Additionally, any PC who becomes Smitten with you during the remainder of the scene may mark XP.
