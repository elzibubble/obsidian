A lifelong 7SS pirate and commitment-phobic serial seducer who jumps from the Bonny-Read to the Big Sister and back after every breakup.

Scoundrel: explore new horizons vs commitment
Inner conflict: believes in nothing, consumed by ennui

#### Aesthetics
Dangerous demeanour
Wearing lots of tight leather, held together by straps
Sword: Basket rapier and main-gauche, hilt covered in soot (from when I escaped a nunnery, which Sofia burned down to try and kill me)
##### Background
* Italian, running from both her own family and that of her ex, Contessa Sofia Ricci (she betrayed me to build her business empire)
* Eligible for a ship after infiltrating the British offices, stealing some very important documents and leaving some slightly altered ones in their place
* Mistress at Arms
##### Relationships
- Who were you Smitten with until recently?
- Who are you currently Smitten with?
- Who has almost as much flair as you?

##### Living in the Moment
Needs to find someone or something to truly care about.
##### Heat of the Moment
When you taunt someone into doing something they want to do but find unwise, roll **+Daring**:
	You may treat a 7–9 result as a 10+ by becoming newly Smitten with the target.
	*If the target is an NPC:*
	10+: They’ll do it in exchange for a small concession or reassurance
	7–9: They choose 1
	* Create an opportunity for you or your allies
	* They give you a String on them
	*If the target is a PC:*
	10+: They mark XP if they do it, and must take a Condition if they don’t
	7–9: You choose 1
	* They mark XP if they do it
	* They take a Condition if they don’t
##### Lust at First Sight
When you become Smitten with someone you barely know, declare your undying love and give them a String on you. Lose your Smitten status with anyone who has no Strings on you. Take +1 forward to any act you think might impress your new interest.
##### Shiny and New
When you give or receive Emotional Support in an intimate moment with someone new, you each mark XP or clear a Condition.
##### Fools Rush In
When you vault into a situation without forethought and wind up way over your head, give someone dangerous to you a String, mark XP, and take +1 forward to Defy Disaster.
##### Rrrip!
When you take or narrowly evade a physical blow from someone dangerous to you, you may declare that your clothes were damaged and are now practically indecent. For the remainder of the scene, when you roll a 10+ on any move against an NPC, you may declare that they have a crush on you (up to one NPC per roll and subject to GM discretion). Additionally, any PC who becomes Smitten with you during the remainder of the scene may mark XP.
