### The Wildcard
Candice Kane, 25
Before I was a detective, I was a glamorous magician's "assistant".
You can tell I'm the Wild Card because I dress and behave inappropriately to throw people off guard.
Deep down I respect the Straight Shooter because of their commitment to protecting his community.

### The Superior
Georgio "The Athenian" Natchios, I tell everyone what to do
The Straight Shooter resents me because: I use the red tape of the law and politics to evade justice and defraud people.
But I'm actually good at: Working the system to my benefit and protecting my people

### The Oddball
Melody Mescal, 22. I remind people to have fun
I'm not a detective because: I'm a journalist
But I get into danger when: investigating paranormal events


### The Straight Shooter
PI Bernardo Rogers, 32
Former Religious Cult Member
Believes in people above institutions
Respects the wildcard because she believe in something greater than her
Pittsburgh Pirates supporter

### The Subordinate
Sr Det. Elvis Docherty, 42. I do what everyone tells me
The Wildcard mocks me because: I cheat on my wife and Bernie blackmails me
But I'm actually good at: Collecting evidence

### The Touchstone
Ex-Det. Charles "Sugar" Kane, 56
I'm not a detective because: Used to be, I lost the use of my legs in a mob hit, causing my retirement
I get into danger when: Old cases come back to haunt me
Trained Bernie up and hired him
