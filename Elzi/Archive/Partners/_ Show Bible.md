Name: Sweet Justice

It's about: Candy is a psychometrist, which she uses on stage. Sometimes it goes off by accident, revealing the case of the week. Could be a mundane murder, could be spooky. In the pilot, she gets herself in way too deep but gets a message to her dad, who sends Bernie to rescue her.
