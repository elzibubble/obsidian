**Mission**: One of the other hunters (Stella) has a crucial role to play in events to come. You must prepare them for their role, and protect them at any cost.

**Moves**:
* Charm: Manipulate Someone
* Cool: Act Under Pressure, Help Out
* Sharp: Investigate a Mystery, Read a Bad Situation
   * What happened here?
   * What sort of creature is it?
   * What can it do?
   * What can hurt it?
   * Where did it go?
   * What was it going to do?
   * What is being concealed here?
* Tough: Kick Some Ass, Protect Someone
* Weird: Use Magic
- Angel Wings: You can go instantly to anywhere you’ve visited before, or to a person you know well. When you carry one or two people with you, roll +Weird. On a 10+ you all go where you wanted. On a 7-9, you don’t quite manage it. Either you are all separated, or you all appear in the wrong place. (*cutting a portal into the air with her sword, bit like a dimension door; or swirling into the sleeve of her kimono*)
- Soothe: When you talk to someone for a few seconds in a quiet voice, you can calm them down, blocking any panic, anger, or other negative emotions they have. This works even if the thing that freaked them out is still present, as long as your voice can be heard.
- Smite: Your body and divine weapon always count as a weakness against the monsters you fight. Your unarmed attacks are 2-harm intimate hand messy.
* Immortal: You do not age or sicken, and whenever you suffer harm you suffer 1-harm less.

**Gear**:
- Lightning sword (3-harm hand stun holy)
- Divine armour (1-armour holy) (*robes*)
* Normal residence in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
* Sometimes stays at a safehouse in Poughkeepsie

**Luck**: X O O O O O O
You can mark off a Luck box to either change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; or change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-harm. If your Luck boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

**Harm**: O O O | O O O O  (when you reach 4 harm, check Unstable)
**Unstable**: O

**XP**: 1

There are several spirit families in the afterlife, from whom shinigami are usually selected. Rukia was just a dead gal but she saw her sister turn into a hollow. This instilled in her sufficient determination to apply for and win a coveted open place at shinigami college (name TBD). She continued to fight through training, overcoming obstacles through sheer effort, while many of the nobles coasted. She graduated third in her class, which caused quite a stir. Her performance gained her some acceptance in soul society, though not with the more traditional families.

**History**:
 * Stella I protected from getting T-boned on her bike.
 * Dani has been introducing me to movies, coffee etc.
 * Rukia tried to hold back, be smart, mark her (defensive) target and it nearly got her killed. What actually worked in the end was taking decisive action - going in for the big hit which opened the heart for Stella. At the same time, while she was in soul society healing up, her captain promoted her from provisional shinigami to full status.
 * During the surgery, I wake up for 30s and instead of soul society, I see men in black masks lowering something moving into my chest.
* During my promotion ceremony, I get a similar experience of a cold empty stone room.
* The last time I got promoted (+ healed) is when I gained Angel Wings. No creepy vision that time.
