Dani grabs the man and throws him outside the building. His bony fingers dig deep into the flesh of her shoulders. It screams out and a similar call echoes in response, incoming. Rukia assesses quickly and charges in, slashing with her sword. Its shirt sloughes off revealing a bony carcass, barely any skin or muscle left.

Witness: George Combs, town librarian. His dad vanished right before he was born, got desperate to find him. Found a card, called a travelling salesman, bought a book, learned some magic. Did the big ritual to find his dad - it worked. His Dad was Herschel Combs, very opposed to interracial marriage, had Bannister bros as flunkies. Herschel appeared in his wizard's hood, burning internally.

Went to see Ed at the church, who was armed with a shotgun and rosary. Got the full story about Herschel. Went to the screaming outside town, Herschel puts us in a ring of fire. Rukia dithers at first but eventually we all go in. Stella attempts to sympathise, grabs his attention and is telepathically assaulted. Dani wrestles him and gets a couple of big swipes in. Rukia goes to 7-harm with a big strike, opening the way for Stella to grab his beating heart out of his chest and crush it.
