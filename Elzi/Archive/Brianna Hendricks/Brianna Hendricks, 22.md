Eldest daughter of Patrick (priest of Tomealina) and Yenna (retired conjuration wizard, now village herbalist). An initiate herself yet already blessed with a couple of minor miracles, more than her dad ever received. 

Family lives on the top floor of the holy library of Tomealina, not much by any real standard but plenty for the yokels of miles around. 

Brandon is the middle, better start learning to be a bard because he's already in trouble with husbands at 19. Currently apprenticed as a carpenter.

Twin girls Lily and Jasmine are 17, Lily is ambidextrous and woodsy while Jasmine is a potential arcane trickster. Maybe found one of her mum's old spellbooks while practicing with thieves' tools and is studying it in secret. Currently studying and theoretically helping at the library. 


Brianna has anxiety. Her siblings are all complete nightmares while she was "the good kid", following in her father's footsteps and expected to keep the little ones in line. She's exceptionally attractive but lacks the charisma to take advantage of her looks. Lately she's been questioning whether Tomealina is for her, she has been studying hard her whole life to please her dad and doesn't know if she can do it any more. Hence disappearing on errands and into the woods for hours.

Good friends with Ren, prayed for Ren's mother before she died.
Has been spending too many evenings at the tavern recently to creep on Niamh.
The tavern is also where she's likely to first interact with Justin's pc. 

Keen fisherwoman! "Sometimes you're the fish, sometimes you're the bait"
Loves hiking and the outdoors. 

Cordelia, her wildfire spirit appears as a fire cat but is really a saprophytic/scavenger fungus. Eats anything dead basically.
Infection is definitely changing Bri's personality, sometimes she's anxious and other times dreamy, nothing matters. Cordy is managing Bri's emotional state for her.
Sleeps on her front on the bare earth, tendrils grow down each night and break off in the morning.
