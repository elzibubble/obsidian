Integrated personality has to be mostly Bri, just more confident and taking no shit. Adds a hardened edge.

post-integration:
Niamh, stop. No. I refuse to be swaddled by your concern for me. I am strong and when I see people being hurt, I'm going to do something about it. If you are too weak to handle this life, then stay at home. I would prefer to have your support but I will no longer accept being seen as less than. You will not scold me, seek to protect me above others or bar me from a fight. Are we clear?
