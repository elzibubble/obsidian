Two mountains nearby, big one thunder mountain; small one (Dobravka) has the Urquell, magic spring
Chrastava: hanging mushroom decorations on everything but they keep falling off or being taken

#### Weavers

Samo asked the Weavers to move here and they dressed him several times.

Granny Ute: says Rosa can't marry Honza because of fairies. Lies! Used to be a miller
Rosa: crush on Honza (Miller), also wants to stay here
Marienka: dreams of being rescued from the drowner by Tlapka, romantic (both Weavers!) 
Tlapka: nightmare oddly calm, trapped under water at bottom of well, drowns without panic 
Bohoshek dreams about being proposed to by Adalinde
Bolislav the drunk: lost wife, don't talk to him about wives or children

Weaver women make it clear they have good relations with the Millers, there's just "some awkwardness" - about Honza + Rosa getting married. Granny Ute said no.

#### Millers

Honza's mum: worried one of her boys is "being like his father"
Honza: Really wants to make a big impression on the Day of Wonders. Can be irresponsible
Vensa: Honza's older (7-8y) brother, settled with kid (Shtefanek). Highly responsible, considerate of his wife.
#### Monsters

Drowner: helps to run the mill, it's a boat tethered in the river, which runs a wheel.
Sometimes "acts out", preventing milling.
King Kovlad: controls Krakono≈°, also probably windshriek that attacked Perun's idol
