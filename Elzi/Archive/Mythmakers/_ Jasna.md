Born 3 days after Koleda

Jasna's ancestors got here in the 650s from the South. Having made enemies with another family they traveled with, only to arrive to Bezemín and find it full of that family's relatives, your father decided to take your chances and build a house further away from the settlement. The place he chose was great for the animals but bad for anything else.

(Something happened between then and your birth. Your parents never talked about it, but you did find some boys' shirts in hidden beneath the clothes chest once. You think that maybe you had older brothers.)

After her father died/left, it was just Jasna and her mother deep in the woods. Jasna took their few goats to pasture every day and then span thread from dawn until dusk. Her only break was to eat her lunch, then sing to herself and dance as she loved to do. One day (when she was 13, perhaps?) she met a beautiful maiden, who entranced her with her grace and they danced all the sunlight away, leaving her with an empty spindle. Her mother was very cross, and more so the second day it happened. But the third day, Jasna cried when it became dusk. The maiden asked why she was crying and filled her spindle for her in the flick of a rabbit's tail. When she got home, her mother gasped because all the thread had turned to gold.

Your mother quickly decided: We're going to Bezemín. There, she patiently and cleverly sold the gold thread in parts: for money, to have a new house built, for a good fence, for new cattle, for tools and clothes and a sword to defend themselves.

Some years later, on the night of Koleda, a great howling was heard in the house. Jasna, (aged 15?) spoke to the větrnice, Míííla, asking her what was wrong. "My dear, snow presses on the trees and the wolves are hungry. You must go into the forest and treat with them".

So Jasna did, but she took the sword, because she was not a silly girl. And Jasna met with the old wolf, ancient and white as the snowy mountains, who asked, "Why should I let my people be hungry when there are good cattle to eat right here? Why shouldn't I snap you up in one bite, tasty maiden that you are?".

Jasna drew her sword and warned them, "I may be tasty but I am also brave, and the first wolf who comes at me will surely die".

The old wolf hurled himself at her and they fought bitterly all night yet never gave more than a light scratch. The other wolves watched silently. In the morning, the wolves withdrew.
The next night, Míííla continued to shriek and so Jasna went out again and battled the old pack leader, though she could not see the other wolves.

The third night, Jasna went out yet again, though she was covered in fine scratches, hurting all over and exhausted. This time, at the end of the night, the ancient beast lay down in the snow, gasping "You are young and not dead yet. I am old and it is my time to die. Take my gift, and with it, accept these three tasks I give you."

"Task one. Find my buried treasure. I found it after the battle of Wogastisburg and buried it nearby because otherwise, the other soldiers would have stolen it from me.
Task two. Find my lost son. He went on a quest to save his lady love from the Underworld. He entered a cave near Thunder Mountain, close to Bílina {White Springs}.
Task three. Find the Vlkodlak that I failed to find. There's a horrible killer in the town of Kouřim. I know it's a Vlkodlak but I couldn't find him."
The second Jasna agreed, the Old Wolf died and her Kresnik power was awakened.

Three days later, she returned to the site of their struggles and took the wolf's pelt to wear. She built a pyre, as we do, and buried the ashes under a mound. Then she told her mother she had to go on a journey.

Jasna followed river banks as much as she could, knowing that making her way through forests and hills would take even longer. Whenever she felt lost, she would fall into a trance-like sleep and project into an animal to scout her way ahead.

In a few months, she reached Ruby Hill aka Wogastisburg, at the same time as an old woman with a donkey and a cart. The witch, Chrastava, stopped Jasna from going inside the cursed fort. While sleeping in her cart, the two were attacked by a Nightwraith. Jasna made her visible with her Frostfire spell and Chrastava found a way to chase her away.

After that, Chrastava was eager to move on and asked Jasna to travel with her. But Jasna was convinced she needed to find Old Wolf's treasure first. She stayed behind for one more month, braving the strange cursed land, avoiding the supernatural creatures, and looking for a needle in a haystack. Exploring the shores of the poisoned Lake Failguard (Nechranice) took longer than expected and she ended up stuck for the winter.

Now, she's finally coming to Bílina.
