**High concept**: disaster-prone clown
**Conflict**: learning to take responsibility for her actions
**Quirk**: Largely unaware of her own class features
**Key personality traits**: Anxious, caring, sad-but-struggling-on. Passing obsessions.
**Voice**: Fran

**Appearance**:
Bubbles is pretty tiny, just under 5' tall. She's wearing a bright red costume that's too big for her, with white ruffles around the neck and down the front. Her nose is also red, which contrasts strongly with her whited-out face but coordinates with her outfit and the battered pointed hat she's wearing.

**History**:
* 1: Left at orphanage of Ilmater
* 5: taken by Witchlight, only blurry kaleidoscopic memories of these 7 years
* 12: deposited at Le Cirque Solange wearing motley, learned some acrobatics + juggling
* 13: got the name Bubbles when Hank held her under the pond while other kids laughed
* 15: forgot to latch the owlbear cage, it got free and ate half the performers. Got a job scrubbing pans at a city inn, The Golden Goblin
* 19: magic activated, used Friends all day without realising and now everyone hates her, ran out of town with a bindle
