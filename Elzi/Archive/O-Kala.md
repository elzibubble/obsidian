O-Kala grew up a feral, urban orphan in the Coronas of Rosohna. One night, after being wracked with terrors, O-Kala found a black, shiny stone in her pocket. The nightmares grew stronger and at one point O-kala was fully possessed by the Raven Queen, who used her to assassinate several nobles. She has tried to rid herself of the stone many times, but it always appears back on her person near instantly. Once or twice, she has caught a glimpse of a raven's eye in its reflection, but has no real idea of who the RQ is.

Having escaped the city, and hiding out in the wilds, she became obsessed with symmetry and numerology, finding solace in order. This awakened a connection to Mechanus which both activated her sorcerous powers and allowed her to free her mind. The trauma set her resolve to gain power, face her tormentor and never be victimised again.

Along her journey, the once nameless girl earned the title of O-kala, or Great Witch, from a village she cleansed of imps. 

The ex-companion was an air genasi named Breeze (pale blue skin, short white hair), who joined the same caravan as a guard. O-Kala (then called Yin) was caring for her donkey before Breeze, bored, called her over for some food. O-Kala, famished but reluctant at first, grabs it with Mage Hand and devours it. They became companionable, with a moment of romantic tension as their hands brush. While O-Kala is simply fleeing Rosohna and her past, Breeze has a concrete destination of Jigow, which she takes up.

A few days hence, bandits attacked. O-Kala was nearly killed by their leader before Breeze, galloping past on a horse, snatched her up. Breeze summoned a storm to destroy the raiders but lost control, unleashing a wild magic surge that shrunk O-Kala and caused Breeze to disappear into the ether.

Losing her friend Breeze sent O-Kala into a rage. She summoned a Rune of Destruction, which obliterated the bandits along with every person, animal and wagon in the caravan, before continuing alone and on foot. The next day, at midday, she sealed away her greatest powers. She has come to regret this, feeling that rather than sealing them, she should have (somehow) found a way to strike directly at the RQ and mutually eliminate.

My clay construct looks like a sandcastle tower, with extra towers jutting out for the arms, ramparts all along the tops of the arms, arrowslits at regular intervals across the whole torso and back. Tiny sand people run back and forth across them to no apparent purpose. There is a large rectangle in the middle of the abdomen.

Turns out the Champion of the Raven Queen sacrifices her name to attain that status.
