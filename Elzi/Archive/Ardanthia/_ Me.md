#### Nadia Rafiqi ("Al-Jamir"), parents Jamal and Fatema

Born to a family which grew rich through arcane dealings with geniekind, everything changed when the mage-hunters arrived. Nadia has no idea why they were welcomed into the country at all, some shady dealings with the Shah no doubt. The Rafiqi family quickly attracted attention, for their rich holdings and magic. Having finished her studies, Nadia was smuggled onto a ship, sailing for a land where no one would recognise her face. She is therefore undercover as Nadia Al-Jamir.

Her immediate priorities are to stay hidden, accrue what personal power she can and keep track of the political situation in Ard Alkubra. If necessary, to return and help to extract her parents. When the land is offered, she'll seize the opportunity to create a safe space for magic users.
