FACE: SUGAR
1️⃣ Chinese; new in town
2️⃣ "Pampered princess to vampirette" - cheerleader by day, she blows out her hair, squeezes into some black velvet and applies her stick-on fangs every night without fail
3️⃣ Liao Yang, 13, she/her

She's tagging along with a PC like a dog on a string; later may bring a certain "don't you know this isn't normal?" outsider perspective
Lived here a year
Bobby Wysowski, future tech bro, calls her racial slurs and makes fun of her for not being great academically or not knowing stuff about Billagoth

She's trying to keep her vampire look a secret from her parents.
Fortunately she gets a sweet allowance so she was able to save up for the fangs. Thinking about it, the black velvet probably doesn't come until 15+, just black t-shirt and princess bluejeans (they're all she has) for now.
Her mom is a slightly disappointed tiger mom, coming to terms that her daughter is not going to be a doctor or a lawyer.
Her dad is a Businessman doing Business most of the time and out drinking with other Businessmen the rest of the time. He makes a big fuss of her whenever he decides to have a 'family day' though, usually a Sunday so that's her favourite day of the week.

Lacrosse team is the Lemurs.

What is odd about the design of The Sins and Virtues?
What hidden meanings did the designer encrypt in the statues’:
* locations, poses, anatomy, and/or facial expressions?
* Sculptor's biography
Paired virtue+sin with message
>From years of living in Billagoth: Fuck the Old Box, and fuck this park especially. The Old Box is creepy enough, but this courtyard is the stuff of nightmares. Kids hate it and even adults get a little nauseous when they try to have a picnic here. The Shakespeare in the park plays always bomb and the patients walking the Asylum gardens are sure as hell not getting any better. The only thing this place is good for is selling drugs, meeting your illicit lovers, or, in case of emergency, hiding from your bullies.

>SUZI: A nerdy classmate’s assessment: There are 13 angelic Virtues and 13 demonic Sins in the park. They’re clearly paired up somehow. The teacher dropped hints that one good assignment topic is identifying a pair of statues and trying to explain the hidden message behind the pairing. Another way to go at it is to look up the sculptor’s biography – either at the school library, or at the Old Box library, or maybe by asking a teacher. That could give you ideas for what the sculptor’s criticizing with his statues.

> Billagoth’s Founding History: Jack Solomon Jr. was the grandson of Billagoth’s founder, Solomon Jack, who founded a gold rush settlement here in 1829. The founder was mayor for 50 years, then he was replaced by his son for 5 years, and then by his grandson for another 5 years. Jack Solomon Jr. then stepped down in favor of Mayor Salinger. Mayor Salinger was the one who turned Billagoth from a gold rush settlement into a proper township in 1889.

>OLD OLD JACK / found the red / mountain’s vein and mined it Solomon said / riches and rank / men’s blood he demanded Die, prophet, die die die die!
   NEW OLD JACK / ran out of red / treasure which he hoarded Whispers spread / the doctors went mad / and did something sordid Stop, director, stop stop stop stop!
   JUNIOR JACK / he gave back / to where he was born in Built in black / the town then cracked / his mind like a bird’s wing Hide, artist, hide hide hide hide!

>AV club info: The church was always a church, and the asylum was always an asylum. But the whole Western corner of the Old Box used to be called ‘Jack’s Seat’ and consisted of Solomon Jack’s trading post with an official hall to one side and bank-like vaults to another side. The Southern building used to look much simpler and functioned as a ‘salacious saloon.’ But the biggest transformation happened to the Eastern segment, which used to be a ‘runners’ station’ (old-timey police) with an oversized jail on both sides. Mayor Salinger reduced the size of the police station to a fraction of what it originally was, and added a library and a post office, thereby canceling the trading post’s ‘monopoly on trade and information’.

>Remembering a teacher sharing that they’ve written a journal article that mentions the creation of the statuary park: Jack Solomon Jr.’s deathbed project, Billagoth Statuary Park, also known as The Sins and Virtues, was scribbled and sketched while he was bedridden. His sketches were delivered daily to his sculptors’ workshop. What was assumed to be his swan song, however, ended up lasting 7 years, with Solomon Jr. adding more and more detail to his sketches. This resulted in a very unique collection of late-19th-century statues. Despite the offer of a higher budget and higher-quality material, Solomon Jr. insisted on light gray limestone and simple iron, claiming that ‘time will reveal the purpose of my choice.’

>The ‘purpose of his choice’ was definitely time making the rust bleed. Whatever they did to the iron, it doesn’t bleed a rusty orange, it bleeds a rusty red, and the light grey stone makes that contrast pop. The Virtues are mostly light grey limestone stained by trickles of what almost seems to be blood; the Sins are mostly red-tinted iron statues with stone detail that is drenched in red staining if it’s at least a little bit positioned beneath a piece of iron. But that’s not all. These statues know many things. Some of these statues are hiding secrets; some of them are trying to reveal them, but no one understands their language; and some of them are screaming their secrets at us, making us shy away and cover our eyes.
