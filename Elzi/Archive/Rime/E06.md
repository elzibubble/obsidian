Met our new invisible friend, Ryker!
Crescent shape fort. Bunker + double doors. No door on the bunker, just a trapdoor - one dwarf inside.
We snuck along the cliff to a frozen stream + culvert, climbed up a well. Found 2 goats in cages, killed a zombie ogre that howled. Took the goats and ran! Duergar pursued us out.

Small reward from the Hook & Sinker for goats. Arranged a booze exchange.
Speaker will notify the council, 17.5gp per left ear.

Killed a couple of sleeping dwarves, looted the chambers there. Went back to prison-like room and killed some fungus-covered people. No loot yet.
